# Contact-angle-prediction-of-polymers
We adopted the classical fully connected network (FFN) architecture commonly used in the Boston housing price prediction task, owing to its reliability and proven effectiveness in regression problems. We trained a neural network regression model using this dataset to predict contact angles, thereby enabling the machine-learning-assisted selection of hydrophilic materials.
